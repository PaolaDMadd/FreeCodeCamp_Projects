      In mid XIV century, in the city of Puteoli, nowadays knows as Pozzuoli, once considered Rome’s countryside, was born a virtuous woman, whom fame was known under Robert I of Anjou kingdom.
</p>
Unfortunately, we don’t have a lot of documentation on her family name or origin.
<p>
She went down in the history as the warrior Maria Puteolana, under King Robert I ’s man and was one of the most brilliant knights. </p>
<p>
She was described as manly and prudent, surrounded by man, but able to be in a military environment and gaining respect and keeping her integrity.
</p>
<p>
She dedicated to the army, and usually wore military uniform than sewing or dressing in women cloths. A lot of men challenged her in one-of-one fights or horse battle, but she won them all.
She’s described as an inherit warrior, who defended the jurisdiction and the honor of her country (kingdom) from the Aragoneses’ neighbors, and compared to the queen of Amazons Oritia and her wife Antiope, who won battles and extended their empire and honor.
</p>
<p>
They say that sometimes Maria alone, or with few men was able to fight the enemy as she was always ready to assault and audacious, her strength was as exemplary as her wit, so to undermine her enemies.
</p>
<p>
The fame of Maria grew outside the kingdom that curious came to see her and some just to fight her to prove her strength.</p>
<p>
Between her admirers there was Robert I, and the poet Francesco Petrarca, who describes her in one of his journals.
Actually, this is the only documentation we have on the existence of this incredible woman Petrarca travelled to Naples twice in 1341, when he was crowned poet of king Robert I of Anjou; and the second time in 1343 on a political encounter with the queen Johanna.
