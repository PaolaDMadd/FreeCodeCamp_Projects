    <p> In mid XIV century, in the city of Puteoli, nowadays knows as Pozzuoli, once considered Rome’s countryside, was
      born a virtuous woman, whom fame was known under Robert I of Anjou kingdom.<p>

        <p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a lot of documentation on her family name or origin. We only know her first name
          Maria and her hometown (Puteoli).</br>
          Maria Puteolana was known to history as one of the most brilliant knights, under King Robert I ’s man.<p>

            <p>She was described as masculine and prudent, surrounded by man, but able to be in a military environment
              and gaining respect and keeping her integrity.<br>

              She was dedicated to the army and usually wore military uniform than sewing or dressing in women cloths. A
              lot of men challenged her in one-of-one fights or horse battle, but she won them all.
              She’s described as an inherit warrior, who defended the jurisdiction and the honor of her country
              (kingdom)
              from the Aragoneses’ neighbors, and compared to the queen of Amazons Oritia and her wife Antiope, who won
              battles and extended their empire and honor.</br>
              The legend says that sometimes Maria alone, or with few men was able to fight the enemy as she was always
              ready to assault and audacious, her strength was as exemplary as her wit, so to undermine her enemies.<p>

    <p>The fame of Maria grew outside the kingdom that curious came to see her and some just to fight her to prove her
      strength.</br>
      Between her admirers there was Robert I, and the poet Francesco Petrarca, who describes her in one of his
      journals.</br>
      Actually, this is the only documentation we have on the existence of this incredible woman. Thanks to Petrarca,
      who travelled to Naples twice in 1341, when he was crowned poet of king Robert I of Anjou;
      and the second time in 1343 on a political encounter with the queen Johanna.</p>
